# Web Scraping Tool

Building a web scrapping tool that, given a search query or a set of seed URLs, discovers companies and extracts detailed information. The tool should gather company name, website URL, contact information, technology stack, current projects, competitors, and other relevant details.

## Minimal Requirements (Core Features)

Implement at least the following core features:

1. **Input Handling and Query Execution:**

    - Accept a user-provided search query (e.g., "cloud computing startups in Europe") or a set of seed URLs.
    - Validate inputs for proper URL formatting and reachability.

2. **Basic Data Extraction (Level 1 - Basic):**

    - **Extract the following details for each company:**
      - **Company Name**
      - **Website URL**
      - **Basic Contact Information:** Such as email addresses or phone numbers (if available)

    - **Output:** Store or display the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON or similar).

3. **Error Handling:**

    - Gracefully manage common issues such as network errors or missing data.
    - Log or display clear error messages when pages canot be processed.

This minimal requirements ensure that even a simple solution demonstrates a clear purpose and functionality.

## Enhancement Features that I need to Implement

### Medium Data Extraction (Level 2 - Enhanced Details)

- **Extended Contact Information:**
  - Social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter)
  - Physical address or location details

- **Company Overview**
  - Brief description or tagline
  - Year founded or operational status

- **Lead Generation Specifics:**
  - Primary products or services offered
  - Industry or market sector

- **Output:** Organize the additional fields clearly in CSV or JSON output format.

### Other Enhancedments

1. **Dynamic Content Handling:**
    - Use headless browsers (e.g., Puppeteer or Selenium) to scrape pages with JavaScript-rendered content.
    - Implement wait mechanisms to ensure dynamic elements load before extraction.

2. **Customization and Flexibility**
    - Allow configuration of CSS selectors, XPath expressions, or regex patterns via configuration file or command-line parameters.
    - Provide a simple CLI or web interface for user inputes and configuration.

3. **Rate Limiting and Proxy Handling**
    - Implement rate limiting or IP rotation to avoid being blocked by target sites.
    - Use request delays to mimic human-like browsing behavior.

4. **Testing and Logging**
    - Write unit or integration tests for key functionalities.
    - Implement logging to record the scrapping process, including successes and any encountered errors.

## Important Criteria

- **Clarity and Simplicity:** The tool should be easy to run and understand, regardless of the number of features implemented.
- **Functionality:** Demonstrate that you tool reliably extracts useful information at least at the Basic level, with optional enhancements as per your chosen complexity.
- **Code Quality:** Maintain clean, well-documented code, and include a README that outlines your design decisions and usage instructions.
- **Creativity and Initiative:** Extra fatures and innovative solutions are encouraged, whether they are simple or advanced.
